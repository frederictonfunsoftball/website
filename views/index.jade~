  h2 Mission Statement
  hr
  p The goal of the league is to get as many people playing as possible. Other leagues offer competitive formats but these formats are not always welcoming to players of all skill levels. This league aims to fill that gap by providing a fun non-competitive league where players of all skill levels are welcome and can enjoy the game.
